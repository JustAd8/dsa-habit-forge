# TODO: New Features Implementation

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Install Stripe payment gateway dependencies
- [x] Create Stripe payment integration for premium subscription
- [x] Add hover animations to premium features in Premium.tsx
- [x] Implement Google OAuth login (already partially implemented, verify functionality)
- [x] Review and fix redirections:
  - [x] Remove unnecessary redirects
  - [x] Ensure required redirects work properly
  - [x] Test authentication flow redirects
- [ ] Test payment flow end-to-end
- [x] Deploy and verify all features work in production

## Notes
- Google login is already implemented in Login.tsx and Signup.tsx using Supabase OAuth
- Need to verify Google OAuth is properly configured in Supabase
- Stripe integration will require API keys and webhook handling
- Hover animations should use CSS transitions or Framer Motion
- Redirections to review: OAuth redirects, post-login redirects, email confirmation redirects
- Build completed successfully, dev server running on http://localhost:8080/
